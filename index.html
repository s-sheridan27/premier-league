      <h1>THE PREMIER LEAGUE</h1>
      <p>
        The Premier League, also known exonymously as the English Premier League or the EPL, 
		is the top level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, 
		it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League. 
		Seasons run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all 19 other teams both home and away).
		Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.
      </p>
      <p>
        The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football 
		League First Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television 
		rights sale to Sky. From 2019 to 2020, the league's accumulated television rights deals were worth around £3.1 billion a year, 
		with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games respectively. The Premier League is a 
		corporation where chief executive Richard Masters is responsible for its management, whilst the member clubs act as shareholders. 
		Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17, with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to 
		English Football League clubs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fifty clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992: forty-eight English and two Welsh clubs. 
		Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Chelsea (5), Manchester City (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), 
		Leicester City (1) and Liverpool
